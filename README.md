# TTL-probe

# This project is about creating cheap but also somehow functional probe for logic circuits.
# If you do a  lot things with procesors it will probably come in handy when you´ll have think like this with you.

# The eagle files i´m uploading is only a reference for you somehow (.brd), for sure you can use the .sch file and create your own PCB layout, or take mine, it´s up to you.

# This project is old like 3 years, i´m uploading it now becouse i said to myself that i could finaly upload something online too, and see how will (if someone) response.

# I wish you good luck with building it, all requerments you will find in the schematic or photos (like the parts etc.)

# Thank you.
